# Airplane Crashes Data Analytics and Visualization
This repository contains a data analytics and visualization project on airplane crashes between 1908 and 2008. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques to gain insights into airplane crash patterns and fatalities.

Project Overview
The project is structured as follows:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing any duplicates or irrelevant entries.
